An Ultima Online™ Server Emulator: Community Edition

## Project Information
> This repository aims to add uniformity within the source code and directory structure between all major releases of the RunUO Ultima Online™ Server Emulator as well as any relevant forks of the project which may be popular. 

## Currently Completed
1. RunUO_v1.x
> formally known as *RunUO_v1.0 Final*, this project was the last official release of RunUO_v1.x, and is currently the most stable revision of the offical release available.

2. RunUO_v2.x
> formally known as *RunUO_v2.3r987*, this project was the last official release of RunUO_v2.x, and is currently the most stable revision of the official release available.

3. RunUO_vCE
> formally known as *RunUO_v2.7*, this project was built upon the release of RunUO_v2.3r987. and has been modified as a community project. This release has been fully updated to be compatible with the Ultima Online™ Mondain's Legacy expansion.





> The restructuring of both the code and the directories within this project will make this emulator fork seem like it has been modified from the original source; I can assure you that *all of the code contained herein has been left unmodified*. The changes which have been made to this repository aim to add uniformity between all major releases of RunUO. My end-goal for all of this is to be able to cross-reference the evolution of code changes between the different versions of RunUO. This will ultimately make converting source code and third-party scripts from one emulation server version to another a lot less tedious of a job than it had previously been.

## Why No Microsoft Visual Studio Solution and Project Files?
> I have refrained from adding the Microsoft Visual Studio project and solution files to the repositories because I really did not want to confuse anyone with the way they are set up. If you would like the Microsoft Visual Studio source that corresponds to this repository, then you can email me and request it: aasr-cdev@protonmail.com
