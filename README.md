An Ultima Online™ Server Emulator: Community Edition

## Project Information
> This repository aims to add uniformity within the source code and directory structure between all major releases of the RunUO Ultima Online™ Server Emulator as well as any relevant forks of the project which may become popular.

## Project Motivations
> This project hit a lot of nerves with people; stating that it was a waste of time and nobody would benefit from it. The truth is that you will not find a better cross-referencing platform from which you can clearly see the evolution of code changes between the RunUO Ultima Online™ Server Emulator releases. What this does is ultimately make converting source code and third-party scripts from one emulation server version to another a lot less tedious and time consuming of a job than it had previously been; when it's all said and done, this project was far from a waste of time.

## Emulators Included
1. RunUO_v1.x
> formally known as *RunUO_v1.0 Final*, this project was the last official release of RunUO_v1.x, and is currently the most stable revision of the offical release available created by the RunUO Software Team.

**compatibility** extends to the following expansions: The Second Age, Renaissance, Third Dawn, Lord Blackthorn's Revenge, Age of Shadows, and the Samurai Empire.

2. RunUO_v2.x
> formally known as *RunUO_v2.3r987*, this project was the last official release of RunUO_v2.x, and is currently the most stable revision of the official release available.

3. RunUO_vCE
> formally known as *RunUO_v2.7*, this project was built using the release of RunUO_v2.3r987 as its foundation, and has been modified by RunUO community developers; this is currently the most stable revision of the RunUO emulator.
