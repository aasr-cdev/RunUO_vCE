An Ultima Online™ Server Emulator: Community Edition

## Project Information
> This repository aims to add uniformity within the source code and directory structure between all major releases of the RunUO Ultima Online™ Server Emulator as well as any relevant forks of the project which may become popular.

## Project Motivations
> This project hit a lot of nerves with people; stating that it was a waste of time and nobody would benefit from it. The truth is that you will not find a better cross-referencing platform from which you can clearly see the evolution of code changes between the RunUO Ultima Online™ Server Emulator releases. What this does is ultimately make converting source code and third-party scripts from one emulation server version to another a lot less tedious and time consuming of a job than it had previously been; when it's all said and done, this project was far from a waste of time.

## Emulators Included
1. RunUO_v1.x
> formally known as *RunUO_v1.0 Final*, this project was the last official release of RunUO_v1.x, and is currently the most stable revision of the offical release available created by the RunUO Software Team.

2. RunUO_v2.x
> formally known as *RunUO_v2.3r987*, this project was the last official release of RunUO_v2.x, and is currently the most stable revision of the official release available.

3. RunUO_vCE
> formally known as *RunUO_v2.7*, this project was built using the release of RunUO_v2.3r987 as its foundation, and has been modified by RunUO community developers; this is currently the most stable revision of the RunUO emulator.

4. ServUO_pub
> formally known as *RunUO_v2.6*, this project was forked and overhauled to be compatible with the latest that Ultima Online™ has to offer. With ServUO_pub you can enjoy using the newest game client with the latest expansion.

## Which One To Use?
> It depends on what type of Ultima Online™ Server you are trying to create. If you want to remake any expansion between *The Second Age* and *Samurai Empire*, then I would suggest you use *RunUO_v1.x* because the packets will be on par with the older game clients that you will need to use in order to play those eras accurately. If you want to remake *Mondain's Legacy* then you will want to use *RunUO_v2.x*, because this release has been updated to work with that expansion. However if you want to remake any expansion from *Kingdom Reborn* to *High Seas*, then you will want to use *RunUO_vCE*, as it has been updated to be compatible with those Ultima Online™ releases.
