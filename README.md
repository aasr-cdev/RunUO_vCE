An Ultima Online™ Server Emulator: Community Edition

## Project Information
> This repository aims to add uniformity within the source code and directory structure between all major releases of the RunUO Ultima Online™ Server Emulator as well as any relevant forks of the project which may become popular.

## Project Motivations
> This project hit a lot of nerves with people; stating that it was a waste of time and nobody would benefit from it. The truth is that you will not find a better cross-referencing platform from which you can clearly see the evolution of code changes between the RunUO Ultima Online™ Server Emulator releases. What this does is ultimately make converting source code and third-party scripts from one emulation server version to another a lot less tedious and time consuming of a job than it had previously been; when it's all said and done, this project was far from a waste of time.

## Emulators Included
1. RunUO_v1.x
> formally known as *RunUO_v1.0 Final*, this project was the last official release of RunUO_v1.x, and is currently the most stable revision of the offical release available.

2. RunUO_v2.x
> formally known as *RunUO_v2.3r987*, this project was the last official release of RunUO_v2.x, and is currently the most stable revision of the official release available.

3. RunUO_vCE
> formally known as *RunUO_v2.7*, this project was built upon the release of RunUO_v2.3r987, and has been modified by RunUO community developers; this is currently the most stable revision of the RunUO emulator.

## Why No Microsoft Visual Studio Solution and Project Files?
> I have refrained from adding the Microsoft Visual Studio project and solution files to the repositories because I really did not want to confuse anyone with the way they are set up. If you would like the Microsoft Visual Studio source that corresponds to this repository, then you can email me and request it: aasr-cdev@protonmail.com
